Mistakes

The definition of mistake is “an action or judgment that is misguided or wrong”, and the result of a mistake can get the person into trouble. So we can say that a mistake is a process, that a person did something wrong and will get a bad result. As it is a bad process, it does not mean that the end absolutely fails. Actually, it can have either a positive or negative effect or both positive and negative. Generally, it depends on the characteristics of the person, it can determine whether a person is likely to resist or give up when he faces a mistake or trouble.
So in some kinds of situations, we even can view a mistake acceptable. The reason why I said that is the following reasons. For every temporal situation, we can divide the situation into 2 zones, the learning zone, and the performance zone. The learning zone, literally, is when the goal is to absorb something new and improve ourselves. In this zone, mistakes are acceptable, as people will learn from it and result in a positive effect, we can even expect mistakes. In the contract, the mistakes in the performance zone will lead to a negative effect, since the goal of it is to use all the knowledge we learned and do something as best as we can, use our experiences to avoid mistakes as much as possible. So we can figure out that it is actually a complex issue, not as simple as most people think. So next, I am going to explain deeply and explore this idea to you.

A Relative World
As it is a constantly improving world, people may find that something that is considered true and proves to be wrong in modern days, and these are widely found in the scientific area. For example, people use to think the earth is flat, this is from what they see as the ground is almost flat. But, later on, people find that the earth actually is a sphere, and from the research, it shows that the curvature of the earth is 0.000126, which is really close to the curvature of 0 when they view is flat. 
	So, it involves another idea, called the magnitude of the mistake. You can see that the things we used to believe, or we believe now, is not always true. People can only view the world in a limited cognitive. But most of the time, the conclusions made by different people, are likely to getting closer and closer to the right answers, as technology development leads to a distinct perception of this world, and the degree of mistakes is falling down.
Take an example. Bloodletting is the view as a good treatment for many centuries. Once, America president Washington got a sore throat and high fever, the doctors used bloodletting to treat him. So nowadays, every person knows that this kind of treatment is completely wrong, so they come up with better solutions. But, in the modern medical areas, the treatment is also not perfect, as it can kill body cells, hurt the body. So in the future, when people find out about new treatment, they might think that the treatment these days that people view as right and likely to use are completely false. But, the magnitude of mistake obviously is smaller, since people come up with new ideas and innovation, and lead to a better consequence compare to the last time.
So in conclusion, we can say that both nowadays ideas and past ideas are false, the only difference is the magnitude of the mistake. Base on these reasons, the world is constantly improving and become better than before.

Mistakes Lead to a Better Life
Most of the people in our life trying to do their best on whatever they do, whether is their job, school, family, or anything else. They try to avoid mistakes, cause they think mistakes are undesirable. However, making mistakes are inevitable, this world is full of mistakes. Meanwhile, just because of these mistakes, people are able to improve from it, and result in a better world.
Base on the research, I found that some of the most successful people in any domain, that have something we can all use for reference. They started the life with a lot of mistakes, and turn their life into fewer mistakes and more achievement. Now, I would like to share with you some inside into why that is and what we can all do about it.
First of all, I have to state that making mistakes is not equal to failure. And, quite the contract, sometimes mistakes can lead people to a better future. It is obvious that people are not likely to make the same mistakes again, since negative emotions in the memory stimulate people to not make mistakes, which clearly indicates that it has a positive effect.
In details, a mistake can improve people’s intelligence quotient. Mistakes are life lessons, it can remind people about what is their weakness, where making no mistake telling them what is their strength.
What is more, making mistake can also improve people’s adversity quotient. A high adversity quotient can make people become more resilient when they meet a trouble and have more ability to drive against the obstacle, which plays a vital role in the world and human’s life.
Here is an example. Jack Ma, who was head of the Alibaba group, comprised many of China’s most popular websites. In 2017, he became the richest person in China. But he was a bad student when he was young. He involved in a lot of fights, and he was compelled to transfer to another school because of it. He failed the entrance exam for college twice. After graduating from college, he applied to 30 different jobs and was rejected by all of them. Except for this, he also makes a lot of mistakes, which increases his experiences and knowledge. We can see that he had a big amount of hardships before he succeeds, which let him able to improve his general capacity. And, there are a lot of people have similar experiences, and they are likely contribute to society more in the future.
In conclusion, It is a constantly improving world, as most of the people attempting to enhance from their mistakes, and these result in a better world in today and future.




Negative Impacts on Making Mistakes
Mistakes can lead to an characteristics of conservative and less creative, as people gradually form a stereotype that mistakes equal to punishments. This kind of perception make people afraid of making mistakes, thus stop to explore the new things, and result in a stagnant situation.
For example, in many family, parents treat their children based on what they behave. If the children do a good job, they give rewards if the children do some bad or not acceptable, they give punishments. That can be a good system in some cases, but it leads to that the children only do the things that their parents thought are right. This makes a conservative world, that children only do what they learn from their parents and reject unknown. Thus they only follow the old staff and become less creative.
What is more, mistakes might lead to more serious situations. In the society, there are groups of people who have depression or other mental disease. These most likely were cause by the negative emotion lead by mistakes and troubles. They cannot take full responsibility to their mistakes or troubles.

Alice Woolley (argues that when judges decide a case immorally, their decisions are wrongful).


	Scott vs. Sandford (Scott, who was a slave and freed by his owner, trying to buy his freedom from his owner’s wife, Sandford, resulting in Scott suing her.One of the judges, Roger Taney, was likely the most racist, basically saying that African-Americans should not be considered citizens of the United States. Scott lost in the court. Finally, Sandford’s second husband Calvin Chaffee, a U.S. congressman and abolitionist, sold him to his original onwer’s son Taylor Blow, and got freedom.)

X-Rays at the Shoe Store was an invention created by Jacob Lowe in 1920, which are extremely dangerous, especially for kids. 

Radioactive Cosmetics (Radioactive element, Radium, discovered by Marie Curie, was soon placed in almost all consumer products).

Insulin Shock Therapy was soon phased out by the lobotomy and first created by Manfred Sakel in 1927, that Patients were shocked with large amounts of insulin to relieve the illnesses by putting them in a state of week-long deep comas. In 1953, British psychiatrist Harold Bourn, attempted multiple times to publish a paper explaining that there was no logical basis for the therapy.

Cocaine-enhanced medicine (addictive drugs). This drug was first used in medicines in 1880, as a way of killing painful symptoms and removing morphine addictions.

Ten common mistakes:
1.Treating the wrong patient
2.Surgical souvenirs (e.g. tool left in body)
3.Lost patients (patients wander around)
4.Fake doctors (con artists)
5.The emergency room waiting game (only a limited amount of beds for patients)
6.Air bubbles in blood (tube that feeds blood is cut out temporarily)
7.Operating on the wrong body part
8.Infection infestation (doctors not washing their hands)
9.Lookalike tubes (e.g. medicine for stomach goes to chest)
10.Waking up during surgery (anesthesia)

A mistake of Dr. Hiatt, killing a baby due to a calculation error with the dosage of medication and led to her suicide. The hospital has changed its policy regarding the verbal ordering of medicine as well as the implementation of a phone line (by RISE, Resilience in Stressful Events) which was launched in 2011 to help doctors who have trouble getting over and admitting their mistakes.

“False negatives”, which is when a person has an illness but is not diagnosed with it. “False positives” occur when a person is told they have an illness but do not contain it.

An embarrassing gaffe that Obama committed during his campaign for president. He made a loose generalization over a group in the midwest by saying “They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.” This offended many people of the small town and ultimately came off as elitist, resulting in him losing the group of people by giving them a clear reason to not vote for them.

Michael Kinsley has described gaffes as a kind of unintended honesty, a moment when a politician (or other public figure) “accidentally reveals something truthful about what is going on in his or her head.” 
Gaffes are for sure the best insight into someone’s true nature, as it provides an unfiltered look at what they are thinking.

Cheryl Thomas & “Brainwashing Stations”
The first gaffe is one where the MP (a member of parliament. This can be thought of as the representative of every electoral vote for each province) of Victoria in British Columbia (Canada) was exposed for past offensive comments posted on social media (which discussed clearly offensive opinions on religious places of worship as being “brainwashing stations”). Soon after, she resigned as a candidate nearly a week before the election. 



Scott Morrison & “The Two Left Feet”
This next gaffe occurred with the current prime minister of Australia, who needed a family picture to be placed on his website for a re-election campaign. However, during the photo shoot, the photo editors realized the incredibly dirty shoes he had been wearing. In an attempt to fix his shoes, the editors replaced both feet with clean white ones. However, they didn’t realize that they added two left feet. The internet mocked the photoshop fail, but Morrison soon got on twitter and joked about the staff fixing his receding hairline as well. This mistake wasn’t severe enough to impact his re-election campaign.

Moon Jae-In & “Good Afternoon” 
While the president of South Korea (Moon Jae-In) visited Malaysia, he mistakenly said the phrase “selamat sore” (Indonesian for good afternoon) to the Malaysian prime minister. He then made a similar mistake at an evening political dinner by saying “good afternoon”. Soon after apologizing for both mistakes, the Malaysian President accepted the apology by saying that it was a completely usable phrase in Malaysia.

Pope Francis & the Hand-Slap
While walking through St. Peter's Basilica on New Year’s Eve, Pope Francis was greeting many people until one woman grabbed the Pope’s hand and yanked him towards her. The Pope then slapped the women’s hand and was visibly annoyed. The next day, he apologized by saying “Love makes us patient. So many times we lose patience, even me, and I apologize for yesterday's bad example”. After looking at the video, it is pretty obvious that the lady yanked and didn’t let go of her grip - with the pope acting on what seemed to be a basic human impulse.

Michael Dukakis & the Tank
While running for president, candidate Michael Dukakis, created an ad that featured him inside a tank to show the Americans that he wasn’t as soft on defensive issues as people thought. George H. W. Bush then stated that the photo made him appear unfit as a military leader, due to the relaxed and unprofessional look of the photograph (this seems like a picture I would take while visited Disneyland with my family: the cars in the background, the helmet that looks like it will fall off, to the look on his face all convey the message of unprofessionalism. Dukakis ended losing pathetically in the election to George H. W. Bush.

These news mistakes are somewhat hilarious. The first mistake was CNN making a technical error by placing Vladamir Putin’s picture as an identified terrorist. The second was a news source, The Chicago Tribune, accidentally announced the wrong winner to the 1948 US election, by announcing Dewey as the president instead of Truman. Based on the fact that as the world becomes more interconnected, news sources will continue to become major influences of our everyday decisions (consider how the Corona Virus was largely blown up by news organizations). Therefore, false information likely results in miss directed actions, which is not favorable for society. As an incentive for news sources to spread accurate information, I would argue that news sources should be required to pay reparations to people affected.
